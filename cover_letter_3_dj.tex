I am writing to apply for the position of assistant professor as advertised on the AEA's Job Openings for Economists. I expect to receive my Ph.D. degree from the Pennsylvania State University in the summer of 2015.  My advisor is Prof. Kalyan Chatterjee, and my research interests broadly cover microeconomic theory, game theory, political economy, and experimental economics.

My job market research investigates communication in social networks. Each player has only part of the information relevant to him. I model communication as repeated collective action, and design a communication protocol leading to the ex-post efficient outcome. By indexing each node's information as a distinct prime number, my communication protocol coordinates players' actions in finite time in finite-tree networks, while the protocol itself constitutes an equilibrium strategy. My results provide a game-theoretic approach to studying dynamic collective action and gives a partial folk theorem for repeated incomplete information games played in networks.

My current research concerns unmediated pre-play communication. I have partially solved the difficulties in implementing correlated equilibria in a class of three-player games by proposing a new condition on the communication protocol. My current work agenda is to explore the features of information diffusion on a network, such as complexity. I also plan to extend my research into modeling further aspects of communication like strategic diffusion in a network.

[some words to school].  

I have attached my job market paper and CV. My references are Kalyan Chatterjee, James Jordan, and Edward Green.  Reference contact details can be found in my CV.  Please let me know if you need anything else.

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you.
